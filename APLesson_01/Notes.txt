Escape characters and ASCII art Notes




Characters with a backslash before them have special meanings; they are called "Escape Characters":
	\t = tab
	\b = backspace
	\n = new line
	\r = carriage return
	\f = form feed
	\' = single quote
	\" = double quote
	\\ = backslash

Using these escape sequences in print statements allows the compiler to interpret them accordingly.

ASCII art is a technique of graphic design on computers.
 - It creates pictures using only the 95 standard printable characters.
 - In other words, it is text-based art
 - It was created partially because early printers often lacked graphics abilities and required characters 
to be used in place of graphic methods.
